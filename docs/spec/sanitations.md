# Sanitation for OpenAPI specification

This document records the sanitation done on top of the official OpenAPI specification from HubSpot CRM Engagements Calls.
The OpenAPI specification is obtained from [Hubspot API Reference](https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-public-api-spec-collection/blob/main/PublicApiSpecs/CRM/Calls/Rollouts/424/v3/calls.json).
These changes are done in order to improve the overall usability, and as workarounds for some known language limitations.

## 1. Change the `url` property of the servers object

- **Original**:
`https://api.hubspot.com`

- **Updated**:
`https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/calls`

- **Reason**: This change of adding the common prefix `crm/v3/objects/calls` to the base url makes it easier to access endpoints using the client.

## 2. Update the API Paths

- **Original**: Paths included common prefix above in each endpoint. (eg: `crm/v3/objects/calls`)

- **Updated**: Common prefix is now removed from the endpoints as it is included in the base URL.

- **Reason**: This change simplifies the API paths, making them shorter and more readable.

## 3. Update the `date-time` into `datetime` to make it compatible with the ballerina type conversions

- **Original**: `"format": "date-time"`

- **Updated**: `"format": "datetime"`

- **Reason**: The `date-time` format is not compatible with the OpenAPI tool. Therefore, it is updated to `datetime` to make it compatible with the tool.

## 4. Protect private information

Replaced the URL in the `hs_call_recording_url` field which contained private information, with a placeholder to prevent data breaches

## OpenAPI cli command

The following command was used to generate the Ballerina client from the OpenAPI specification. The command should be executed from the repository root directory.

```bash
bal openapi -i docs/spec/openapi.json --mode client -o ballerina --license docs/license.txt
```

Note: The license year is hardcoded to 2025, change if necessary.
